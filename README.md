While studying for my exam recently, I found that professors only had old question papers and my seniors were unable to provide new ones. I wanted to address a problem that I saw as a gap. I'm creating a platform to consolidate these resources and address this issue for future students with the support of my robust college network. My enthusiasm for applying web programming to concrete, real-world issues is evident in this effort.
